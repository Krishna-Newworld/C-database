This is a normal simple database program
in which we have use

structs

file handling

file modes(r, b, rb+, wb etc.)

an 'add' function that adds products to the database

a 'modify' function that modifies the product selected

and a 'delete' function that deletes any particular product selected

"define.h" - dedicated to defining a struct and 
#include"define.h" to use it in multiple files
